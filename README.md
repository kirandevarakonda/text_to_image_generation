## Introduction

This project utilizes a pretrained text-to-image generation model from StabilityAI to create images based on textual prompts. The model, part of the Stable Diffusion framework, generates high-quality images by interpreting the given text.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, use the following commands in your Colab notebook or local setup:

```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install --quiet --upgrade diffusers transformers accelerate mediapy
